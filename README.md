## Project Specifications

Build a React application that will use JWT auth. The application will have three types of users with differing display "pages" for each. The application will allow logging into a RESTful API that is using JWT auth as well.

The application will also allow the creation of a new user account via the API. This functionality may not be available in our demo API, so this feature may remain untested.
